## Introduction
Implementation of basic ML models and some demo applications
## Tools
implementaion of basic and most popular machine learning models, including:  
*Classifier*
+ k nearest neighbors  
+ logistic regression: gradient descent  
+ decision tree: ID3 algorithm  
+ naive bayes  
+ Error estimator: resubstitutions  

*Predictor*  
+ linear regression: normal equation  

*Cluster*  
+ k-means  
+ GMM: EM algorithm  

*Pre-processor*  
+ standardization  
+ normalization: L1 norm, L2 norm  

*HMM*  
+ Probability estimation: forward-backward algorithm  
+ Optiaml hidden path: Viterbi algorithm  
+ Parameter estimation: Baum-Walch algorithm
