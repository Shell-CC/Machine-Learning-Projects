# Machine-Learning-Projects
## Introduction
Implementation of basic ML models and some demo applications
## Tools
implementaion of basic and most popular machine learning models, including:  
*Classifier*
+ k nearest neighbors  
+ logistic regression: gradient descent  
+ decision tree: ID3 algorithm  
+ naive bayes  
+ SVM: SMO

*Predictor*  
+ linear regression: normal equation  

*Cluster*  
+ k-means  
+ GMM: EM algorithm  

*Pre-processor*  
+ standardization  
+ normalization: L1 norm, L2 norm  
+ Dimension reduction: PCA, Exhaustive-search selection  
+ Encoder: one-hot encoding  

*Model Selection*  
+ Error estimator: resubstitutions, leave-one-out cross-validation  

*HMM*  
+ Probability estimation: forward-backward algorithm  
+ Optiaml hidden path: Viterbi algorithm  
+ Parameter estimation: Baum-Walch algorithm  

## Applications  
*Digit Recognition*  
+ Classify handwriten digits using this toolkit.

*Restuarant Revenue Prediction*
+ A kaggle compitition from TFI, [more](https://www.kaggle.com/c/restaurant-revenue-prediction).  
+ Predict annual sales based on the provided data.  

*Gene-expression classification*  
+ Search for gene feature sets that best discriminate the two prognosis classes  
+ These data come from a well-known microarray-based cancer classification study, [paper here](http://www.ece.tamu.edu/~ulisses/ECEN649/BRC_NEJM.pdf).
